What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.

Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.

Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.

Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.


bins in histograms is width of each column 
 # part 1 
x = [_ for _ in range(0,10)]
y = [_*_ for _ in range(0,10)]  #--------> it will square the number 

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca() # gca mean get current axis 

ax.set_xticks(np.arange(0, 10, 1))
ax.set_yticks(np.arange(0,100,10))

plt.scatter(x,y)

plt.grid()

plt.show()

#part2 
plt.plot([x for x in range(0,10)])  # it will plot the simple graph 

#part3 
plt.plot([x * x for x in range(0, 10, 1)], 'red', marker='p')
plt.plot([x * x for x in range(9, -1, -1)], 'green', marker='p')
plt.show()

#part3 
data = [10,15,15,10,20,20,1,14,10,12,14]
plt.hist(data)
plt.show()
